# iceDAQ
Real time data acquisition based on the Lattice ICEstick hardware

Goal: **16 simultaneous audio channels, 8-bit resolution @ 44100Hz sampling rate** (this hardware will be used to build a ["ball array" microphone](http://www.mattcastille.com/me/wp-content/upload/2009/09/tn_IMG_4178.jpg) that allows for electronic directivity/gain control).

Quick calculations say that it should be possible to record the 16 channels in parallel using two 8to1 multiplexers (74HC4051) and two ADCs ([AD7813](http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/AD7813.pdf) gives 400ksps).


FTDI software modification for high speed serial
--

The main bottleneck was the serial port speed, since it is necessary to transmit at least 16 * 8 * 44100bits/s. We can see that **115200 bauds are not enough**. That is why we have researched the characteristics of the FTDI module on board the ICEstick (FT2232H).
For high-speed applications, the most common approach is to use the "245 FIFO" mode, where the FTDI chip reads 8 bit values in parallel (8 physical pins) and sends the byte through the USB port.
Since those pins are not correctly connected in the ICEstick board, we needed a different approach. So we found another working mode for the FTDI, called ["Fast Opto-Isolated Serial Mode"](https://github.com/carlosgs/iceDAQ/raw/master/doc/AN_131_FT2232D_H_Fast%20Opto-Isolated%20Serial%20Interface%20mode.pdf).

This mode is like a serial port but with a clock signal (up to 12MHz in the ICEstick), so the data rate limit is much higher.
Best part of it is that **no additional drivers seem to be necessary in order to have access to the higher velocities (>5Mbps)** from Python.
Here is a "logic analyzer" script that shows in the terminal the status of 8 pins of the ICEstick board:  
Verilog code: <https://github.com/carlosgs/iceDAQ/tree/master/logic_analyzer>  
Python script: <https://github.com/carlosgs/iceDAQ/blob/master/logic_analyzer/python/readAndPrint.py>  

Note: In order to use the code **it is first necessary to re-configure the FTDI module on board the ICEstick**. This is done with the [FT_PROG](http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Utilities.htm#FT_PROG) program (only for windows... we need to find alternatives).
Once the program is running, you should select "Port B->Hardware" and assign the "OPTO Isolate" mode ([screenshot of the menu](https://sites.google.com/site/100randomtask/usb-to-serial-converter-samples/ft2232-to-adc0820-adc-demo/FTprog%20Screenshot.JPG?attredirects=0))  
*It is important not to modify Port A, since the FPGA is programmed through that port*  
To revert the changes, you just need to do the same thing and select back the "RS232 UART" mode.


Accurate sampling frequency using a PLL
--

Next task is to generate a 44100kHz clock using the PLLs (phase-locked loops). Example: [generating a 1Hz signal](pll_example/pll_example.v).
